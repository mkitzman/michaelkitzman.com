      <h3 className={"Work-history-title"}>Medallia - Sr. Design Engineer</h3>
      <h4 className={"Work-history-sub-title"}>April 2018 - May 2022</h4>
      <p>
        Working on the Alchemy design system used across Medallia and its
        acquired companies. The design system is built in React and Typescript
        using Styled-components, tested with React Testing Library and
        documented on a Gatsby website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of a small team that created the component library from scratch.
        Because of our work Medallia has been able to unite design across their
        websites by utilizing our pre-made UI React components and elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating a new component allowed me to grow several skill sets beyond my
        core skills including API design, accessibility with a minimum WCAG 2.0
        AA compliance and comprehensive testing using React Testing Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        Extensively documented all components I worked on including examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working closely with design on implementing their mocks to insure that
        they stay true to the design but also take into account possible
        browser, accessibility and ux issues that may arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Helped teams onboard to Alchemy by answering questions, code reviews,
        debugging issues and adding requested features.

            I'm a Front-End Engineer with over 20 years of experience building web sites that have 
            been viewed by billions of people. I primarily work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

            On a personal side I love sports ( Broncos, Lakers, Chelsea, Nationals, Capitals) 
            trying craft beer (Aslin, The Veil Brewing, Tired Hands, Other Half and Trillium, playing guitar, 
            music and design.
